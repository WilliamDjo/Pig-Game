# Game Rules

On a turn, a player rolls the die ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on the die ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. When a player reaches a total of 100 points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
